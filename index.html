<p>Windows Console is the infrastructure for console applications in Microsoft Windows. An instance of a Windows Console has a screen buffer and an input buffer. 
    It allows console apps to run inside a window or in hardware text mode (so as to occupy the entire screen). The user can switch between the two using the Alt+â†µ Enter key combination. 
    The text mode is unavailable in Windows Vista and later. Starting with Windows 10, however, a native full-screen mode is available.You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript. The JavaScript console log function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console. To open the browser console, 
    right-click on the page and select Inspect, and then click Console.</p>

<script>
console.log("my first console project");
console.log(5 + 6);
console.log(4 + 10);
